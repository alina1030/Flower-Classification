**AIM**
The main aim of the project is to classify or categorize the flowers into three different classes namely setosa, virginica and versicolor using classification models. A comparative analysis of the models are done to identify which one is the best. We start by using an iris dataset and proceed to preprocessing this dataset. The next primary step would be to split the data into training and testing dataset as this is very essential in any machine learning model. We standardize the values and pass these values to the machine learning model. Each machine learning model use different parameters. Using these parameters we train and predict to see if the model can accurately classify the flowers or not. We evaluate the models using metrics like accuracy, recall, F1 score and confusion matrix. To enhance the model we hyper tune the parameters.

**METHODOLOGY**
1. Read the dataset
2. Preprocess the dataset(data cleaning)
3. Splitting data into training and testing
4. Standardization of data
   - Fitting & transforming train data
   - Transforming testing data
5. Classification and prediction using SVC, NAive Bayes, Random Forest and Decision Tree Classifier
6. Evaluating the model
7. Fine-tuning of parameters
